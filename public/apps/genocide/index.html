						<h3>TIME PERIOD</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>Under Stalin's dictatorship in the USSR</li>
							<li>Reminiscent of the french "Reign of Terror"</li>
							<li>During the late 1930s after WW I at the time of the Great Depression</li>
							<li>Assassination of Kirov to the end of the Gulags</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h3>THE BEGINNINGS</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>The Russian democide started under the rule of Stalin. Stalin came to power in 1924 after Lenin’s death</li>
							<li>In his effort to become an absolute ruler, he created the NKVD and used it to incite fear in his people</li>
							<li>With the power over his people, his plan was to restore the Soviet Union to its former glory and he believed
								that if the country were to be strong, it needed to be united under him</li>
							<li>His overall plan was to bring industrialization to the USSR</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h3>THE PURPOSE</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>To Make Russia Great Again</li>
							<li>He believed that if they didn’t industrialize in ten years under his rule, that Germany would invade and conquer the Soviet Union</li>
							<li>To start the industrialization process, he “tightened the screws” and put the gulag prisoners to work to increase the country’s industrial growth</li>
							<li>Because of Stalin’s paranoia, any person or group of people that seemed as if they were a threat to him or his regime were killed</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h3>HIS METHODS</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>Show trials were where Stalin’s political opponents were forced to plead guilty to treason and were either executed or imprisoned</li>
							<li>Labor camps were used to increase production and created an incentive to obey Stalin</li>
							<li>Citizens who did not agree with Stalin’s principles of collectivization and communism were sent to these camps</li>
							<li>Workers were starved, beaten, and forced to work for extended periods of time without rest</li>
							<li>Assassinations carried out by the NKVD, were used to eliminate opponents of Stalin</li>
							<li>To get rid of traitors, spies, and groups against the regime, Stalin utilized mass executions</li>
							<li>Artificial famines were used to suppress revolutionaries in both Russia and Ukraine</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h3>MAJOR FIGURES</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>Stalin was initially one of the seven members of Politburo alongside Lenin and Trotsky.
								In 1924, after the death of Lenin, he quickly eliminated any and all opposition.
								He substituted the New Economic Policy introduced by Lenin with a centralized command administration,
								launching a period of industrialization and collectivization that led to the conversion of the USSR from
								an agrarian nation into a modern power. However, the economic changes concurred with the incarceration of
								millions of people in Gulag labor camps. Between 1934-1939, he organized and led an extensive purge, the “Great Purge”,
								of the political party, state, armed forces and intelligentsia, in which millions of so-called "enemies of the working class"
							  were jailed, exiled, or executed, often without due process.</li>
							<li>Felix Dzerzhinsky, known as Iron Felix, was a Soviet statesman, and a key member of revolutionary movements.
								He was part of many revolutionary committees such as the Polish Revlon as well as both official Russian and Soviet positions.
								Dzerzhinsky is most known for establishing and developing the secret police forces of the USSR, serving as the head director 1917-1926.</li>
							<li>Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich, known as Iron Lazar, was a Soviet politician and administrator as well as one of the principal associates
								of Joseph Stalin. Kaganovich helped to place Stalin's supporters in significant jobs within the Communist Party bureaucracy and played a
								fundamental role in the collectivization policy that caused the catastrophic 1932–33 famine.</li>
							<li>Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda served as a director of the NKVD, the Soviet Union's security, and intelligence agency 1934-1936.
								After being promoted by Stalin, Yagoda managed the arrest, show trial, and execution of the Bolsheviks Lev Kamenev and
								Grigory Zinoviev, events which began the Great Purge. Yagoda also oversaw the construction of the White Sea–Baltic Canal
								utilizing slave labor from the Gulag system, during which millions of laborers died.</li>
							<li>Nikolai Yezhov, also known as Ezhov, was a Soviet secret police official under Joseph Stalin.
								He was head of the NKVD from 1936 to 1938 during the Great Purge. After directing the mass arrests
								as well as executions during the Great Purge, Yezhov became a victim of it himself as he was later arrested and was executed in 1940.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h3>EFFECTS</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>The increase in the number of factories and the efficiency of the labor camps allowed the country to produce more products at a faster rate</li>
							<li>Made the USSR an industrial and a war ready country</li>
							<li>Resulted in an overall loss of life projected between 20 to 60 million</li>
							<li>Long lasting scar in Russias history</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h3>GLOBAL RESPONCES</h3>
            <ul>
						  <li>Anti-communist propaganda</li>
							<li>In western countries, the information that managed to get out was seen more as rumors than facts</li>
						</ul>
