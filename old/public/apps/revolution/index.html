						<h1 class="level">1</h1>
						<h2>Proclamation of 1763</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The Proclamation of 1763 drew a line across the Application Mountains to prevent colonial expansion westward. This was to prevent conflict with natives while Britain was still recovering from the French and Indian War.</p><hr>
					<p>This event is placed at 1 on the meter since it mildly increased tensions between them. This was because while the colonists were not allowed to settle, they knew the line was weakly enforced.</p>

					<header>
						<h1 class="level">2</h1>
						<h2>Sugar Act, 1764</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The Sugar Act was created when Britain was in need of funds to pay past war debts and needed to reconsolidate its empire. While the act decreased the taxation of molasses, it strengthened the power of British Admiral Courts.</p><hr>
					<p>This event is placed at 2 on the meter since it mildly increased tensions between them. This was because the colonist viewed it as a way for Britain to profit from the colonies and the act took away trial by jury for colonial merchants.</p>

				<a href="#" class="image fit"><img class="catpic" src="images/cat_4.jpg" alt="" /></a>

					<header>
						<h1 class="level">4</h1>
						<h2>Stamp Act, 1765</h2>
					</header>
					<p>To raise funds after the French and Indian War, Britain passed the Stamp Act. With this, any time that was printed including newspapers, stamps, and books were taxed.</p><hr>
					<p>This event is placed at 4 on the meter since it moderately increased tensions between them. This was because colonists believed that their taxes should be passed by their colonial assemblies instead of Parliment, leading to petitions and boycotts.</p>

						<h2>Declaratory Act, 1766</h2>
					</header>
					<p>After the repeal of the Stamp Act due to economic pressure, Parliment passed the Declaratory Act. This stated that Parliment had the right to pass acts and control the taxation in the colonies.</p><hr>
					<p>This event is placed at 3 on the meter since it mildly decreased tensions between them. This was because the colonist rejoiced over the removal of the Stamp Act and saw the Declaratory Act as meaningless.</p>

						<h2>Townshend Duties, 1767</h2>

					<p>When Charles Townshend came to power, he passed the Townshend Duties which aimed to regulate trade and not to increase revenue. This included the payment of colonial governors from Britain and the reinforcement of colonial regulatory agents.</p><hr>
					<p>This event is placed at 6 on the meter since it moderately increased tensions between them. This was because it took away colonists' control of their leadership and they responded with boycotts in large numbers, petitions, and newspaper attacks</p>

						<h2>Tea Act, 1773</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Over time the British East India Company began to accumulate massive amounts of unsold tea.  To sell it off they passed the Tea Act which was supposed to convince the colonists to purchase Company Tea.</p><hr>
					<p>This event is placed at 12 on the meter since it mildly increased tensions between them. This was because the colonists recognized the implications of the act, and dumped the tea out of the ships and the colonists were still being taxed without representation.</p>

						<h2>Intolerable Acts, 1774</h2>
